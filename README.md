# ActionScript 3: Undefined Variable in Trace Statement

This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: using an undefined variable within a `trace` statement.  The error arises because the compiler doesn't automatically handle undefined variables during runtime tracing.

The `bug.as` file shows the erroneous code, resulting in a compiler error. The `bugSolution.as` file presents the corrected code.
